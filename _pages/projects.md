I'm interested in **Theoritical Mathematics** as well as applied mathematics in various fields like neuroscience, physics and cryptography. 
Working as a research intern in one of these fields is a goal for me in 2026

## Current Focus

I am currently strengthening my foundations in pure and applied math as well as in computer science :

### 📖 Theory
* **Deep Learning Foundations:** I am currently working through *"Understanding Deep Learning"* by **Simon J. Prince**.
    * *Focus:* Gaining an intuitive understanding of foundations in ML.
* **Mathematical Background:** Leveraging my curriculum at **Magistère d'Orsay** (L3) to master Advanced Algebraic Strucures (groups,rings,modules,graphs), Measure Theory, Probability, Dynamic Systems.

### 💻 Technical Training
I maintain an active practice of coding algorithms to ensure my implementation skills match my theoretical understanding:

* **Competitive Programming:**
    * **Prologin 2026:** Currently preparing for the French National Computer Science Contest.
    * *Focus:* Solving advanced algorithmic problems to sharpen problem-solving skills under constraints.
* **Machine Learning Engineering:**
    * [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com) & [TensorTonic](https://www.tensortonic.com): Solving deep learning problems using Python (either from scratch with numpy or with Pytorch)
* **System & Security:**
    * [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/underthehat) (CTF): I participate in security challenges to maintain robust general computer science skills and system understanding.
