I am interested in **Theoretical Mathematics** as well as applied mathematics in fields such as neuroscience, physics, and cryptography. 
Landing a research internship in one of these domains is my primary goal for 2026.

## Current Focus

I am currently strengthening my foundations in pure and applied mathematics, alongside advanced computer science training:

### 📖 Theory
* **Deep Learning Foundations:** I am currently working through *"Understanding Deep Learning"* by **Simon J. Prince**.
  * *Focus:* Gaining a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations of ML.
* **Mathematical Background:** Leveraging my curriculum at **Magistère d'Orsay** (L3) to master Advanced Algebraic Structures (Groups, Rings, Modules), Graph Theory, Measure Theory, Probability, and Dynamical Systems.

### 💻 Technical Training
I maintain an active practice of coding algorithms to ensure my implementation skills match my theoretical understanding:

* **Competitive Programming:**
  * **Prologin 2026:** Currently preparing for the French National Computer Science Contest.
  * *Focus:* Solving advanced algorithmic problems to sharpen problem-solving skills under constraints.
* **Machine Learning Engineering:**
  * [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com) & [TensorTonic](https://www.tensortonic.com): Solving deep learning problems using Python (implementing from scratch with NumPy or using PyTorch).
* **System & Security:**
  * [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/underthehat) (CTF): I participate in security challenges to maintain robust general computer science skills and system understanding.
