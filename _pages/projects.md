My academic focus is on **Theoretical Mathematics** with an interest in computer science and physics. Securing a research internship at the intersection of some of these fields is my primary goal for 2026.
## Academic & Technical Focus

* **Mathematics (Magistère d'Orsay, L3):** Advanced Algebraic Structures, Graph Theory, Measure Theory, Probability, Dynamical Systems.
* **Deep Learning Theory:** Currently reading *"Understanding Deep Learning"* by Simon J. Prince.
* **Applied ML:** Solving problems on [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com) and mastering PyTorch via [LearnPyTorch.io](https://www.learnpytorch.io/).

## Recent Competitions
**Dec 2025 — TRACS**
* A high-level CTF (Capture The Flag) organized by the French external intelligence agency.


## Upcoming Competitions
**Jan 2026 — Hack'in Saclay** 
* AI Hackathon organized by Start In Saclay and ENSAE Paris
* **Targeted skills:** Collaborative development under strict time constraints. Developping agentic prototypes.

**Feb 2026 — Prologin**
* Competitive programming semi-finals of the French National Computer Science Competition organized by EPITA and Mistral IA
