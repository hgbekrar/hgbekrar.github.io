My academic goal is to bridge the gap between **Fundamental Mathematics** and **Artificial Intelligence** to tackle complex problems in natural sciences.

I am particularly interested in the emerging field of **AI for Science**, believing that deep learning architectures—when grounded in rigorous mathematical theory—can unlock new understanding in fields like Neuroscience, Biology, and Physics.

## 🔭 Current Focus

I am currently strengthening my foundations in Machine Learning theory and applied mathematics through the following resources:

### 📖 Literature & Theory
* **Deep Learning Foundations:** I am currently working through *"Understanding Deep Learning"* by **Simon J. Prince**.
    * *Focus:* Gaining a geometric and probabilistic perspective on deep learning models.
    * *Goal:* Implementing core algorithms (Transformers, Diffusion Models) from scratch using Python/NumPy.
* **Mathematical Background:** Leveraging my curriculum at **Magistère d'Orsay** (L3) to master Measure Theory, Probability, and Convex Optimization.

### 💻 Technical Training
I maintain an active practice of coding algorithms to ensure my implementation skills match my theoretical understanding:

* **Machine Learning Engineering:**
    * [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com) & [TensorTonic](https://www.tensortonic.com): Solving linear algebra and calculus problems specifically designed for neural network backpropagation and tensor manipulation.
* **Algorithmic Agility:**
    * [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/underthehat) (CTF & Security): I participate in hackathons to maintain robust general computer science skills and system understanding.
